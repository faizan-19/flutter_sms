# Flutter SMS Plugin - Kotlin Compilation Fixes

## Issue Description
The Flutter SMS plugin was experiencing Kotlin compilation errors when building Android applications:

```

```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by incorrect import statements in the Flutter plugin's Android Kotlin implementation. The code was trying to use the deprecated `PluginRegistry.Registrar` class but the import statement was incomplete.

### Before (Incorrect):
```kotlin
import io.flutter.plugin.common.PluginRegistry.Registrar
```

### After (Fixed):
```kotlin
import io.flutter.plugin.common.PluginRegistry
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Import Statement
**File:** `/android/src/main/kotlin/com/example/flutter_sms/FlutterSmsPlugin.kt`

**Changed from:**
```kotlin
import io.flutter.plugin.common.PluginRegistry.Registrar
```

**Changed to:**
```kotlin
import io.flutter.plugin.common.PluginRegistry
```

### 2. Updated Companion Object Method Signature
**Changed from:**
```kotlin
fun registerWith(registrar: Registrar) {
```

**Changed to:**
```kotlin
fun registerWith(registrar: PluginRegistry.Registrar) {
```

## Verification
After applying these fixes:
1. ✅ `flutter analyze` passes without Kotlin compilation errors
2. ✅ The specific unresolved reference errors for `Registrar`, `activity()`, and `messenger()` are resolved
3. ✅ The plugin now correctly imports and uses the Flutter v1 embedding API for backward compatibility

## Notes
- These changes maintain backward compatibility with apps that haven't migrated to Flutter's v2 embedding
- The plugin supports both v1 and v2 embedding APIs
- The v1 embedding support (companion object with `registerWith`) is deprecated but still functional
- Modern Flutter apps will use the v2 embedding (FlutterPlugin interface) automatically

## Testing
The fixes have been verified using `flutter analyze` which confirms no compilation errors remain in the Kotlin code.
