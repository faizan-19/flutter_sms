# Solution for Flutter SMS Plugin Kotlin Compilation Errors

## Problem
Your other project is still getting Kotlin compilation errors because it's using a cached version of the plugin that doesn't have the fixes.

## Solution

You have two options to resolve this:

### Option 1: Clear Flutter Pub Cache (Recommended)

Run these commands in your other project directory:

```bash
# Clear the pub cache for this specific package
flutter pub deps
flutter pub cache repair

# Or clear all pub cache (more thorough)
flutter pub cache clean

# Then get dependencies again
flutter pub get
```

### Option 2: Update Your Dependency Reference

If you're using a git dependency in your `pubspec.yaml`, you can force it to use the latest commit:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_sms:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/faizan-19/flutter_sms.git
      ref: 862ef22  # Use the latest commit hash
```

Then run:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Option 3: Restart and Clean (If above doesn't work)

```bash
# In your other project directory
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

## What We Fixed

1. ✅ **Fixed Kotlin import statement** in the plugin
2. ✅ **Updated method signature** to properly reference PluginRegistry.Registrar  
3. ✅ **Bumped version** to 2.3.4
4. ✅ **Committed and pushed** changes to GitHub

## Verification

After clearing the cache, try building your project again:

```bash
flutter build apk --debug
```

The Kotlin compilation errors should now be resolved.

## Why This Happened

Flutter caches Git dependencies in `~/.pub-cache/git/` and doesn't automatically update them even when you push new commits. You need to manually clear the cache or reference a specific commit to get the latest changes.
